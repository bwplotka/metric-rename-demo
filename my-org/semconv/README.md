NOTE: Current version of diff is [not sufficient](https://github.com/open-telemetry/weaver/blob/b474b9d55b70200502ceb9732a93a5b0371a53aa/docs/schema-changes.md#future-evolutions), so
this demo uses an experimental implementation of [the following doc](https://github.com/open-telemetry/weaver/blob/b474b9d55b70200502ceb9732a93a5b0371a53aa/docs/schema-changes-explorations-for-future-evolutions.md).
